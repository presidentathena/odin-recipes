        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
            Pastel de tres leches is a sponge cake that's steeped in three kinds of milk: condensed, evaporated, and heavy cream.
        </p>
        <p>
            The soaked cake is served with whipped cream and sliced fresh strawberries. Store any leftovers in the refrigerator.

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <h5>Cake:</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>6 medium eggs, separated</li>
            <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
            <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1/2 cup milk</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon baking powder</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
        </ul>

        <h5>Tres Leches:</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>1 (14 ounce) can sweetened condensed milk</li>
            <li>1 (12 ounce) can evaporated milk</li>
            <li>1 cup heavy whipping cream</li>
        </ul>

        <h5>For Serving:</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup whipped cream (Optional)</li>
            <li>1 cup sliced fresh strawberries (Optional... but they shouldn't be!)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 10x15 inch baking dish.</li>
            <li>Make the cake: Beat egg whites in a large mixing bowl with an electric mixer on high speed until stiff peaks form. Gradually beat in sugar until mixture is glossy. Beat in egg yolks, one at a time, beating well after each addition. Reduce the speed to medium and mix in flour, about 1 tablespoon at a time. Mix in milk, baking powder, and vanilla. Pour batter into the prepped baking dish.</li>
            <li>Bake until lightly browned on top and a toothpick in the center comes out clean, about 25 minutes. Remove from the oven and let cool for 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Make tres leches: Combine condensed milk, evaporated milk, and cream in a blender. Pulse several times until well blended.</li>
            <li>Pour tres leches over cake. Cover and refrigerate until cake is cold and all liquid has been absorbed at least 1 hour.</li>
            <li>Cut chilled cake into 12 squares. Top each serving with a dollop of whipped cream and a few sliced strawberries.</li>
        </ol>
