        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2/3 cup olive oil</li>
            <li>2/3 cup soy sauce</li>
            <li>1/4 cup lemon juice</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons liquid smoke</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons spicy brown mustard</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons garlic powder</li>
            <li>4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Mix olive oil, soy sauce, lemon juice, liquid smoke, mustard, pepper, and garlic powder together in a large glass or ceramic bowl.</li>
            <li>Place chicken in bowl and turn to coat with marinade. Cover and marinate in the fridge for 1-4 hours. For best results, do not marinate longer than 4 hours.</li>
            <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil the grate.</li>
            <li>Remove chicken from marinade and shake off excess. Discard the remaining marinade.</li>
            <li>Cook chicken until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, 6-8 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
